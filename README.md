## Local Development
### Dependencies
You will need to have node installed to run the app (I'm using v14, I believe >= v12
should work).

### Running the app
First make sure all dependencies are installed. Navigate to the main folder and 
run `npm install`. Once that is complete, to run the application you just run
`npm run dev` (also from the main directory). The webapp can be accessed
 at http://localhost:3000

### Running tests
Tests can be run by navigating to the main directory and running `npm run test`.
